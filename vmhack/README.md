# Vmhack â€“ finding and exploiting self-generated code constraints in a RISC-V32 executable with XOR-decryption, [z3](https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/z3.html) and [capstone](https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone)
## First glance

## First thoughts
After you extracted the tar you will notice a `puzzle2` and a `vm` binary, such as in [hackvm](./../hackvm/). We can just go and execute the binaries as shown by the instructions on the web endpoint. </br>

Huh, strange. Nothing gets printed after having entered a password. After checking the file types (`file '_YOUR_FILE'`) you will notice that the `vm` and `puzzle2` binaries are again, of type ELF 64-bit and ELF 32-bit RISC-V. You will additionally notice that the `diff` command when comparing the vm binary to the vm binary of the hackvm puzzle results with no visible output, which implies that they have no difference at all and are the same. So the change must be in the `puzzle2` one.

// two executables called vm and puzzle2, examining puzzle2 with Ghidra, finding code section
## First steps
Let's directly examine `puzzle2` with Ghidra. You can find a C-Code representation [here](./code/puzzle2.c). All in all the code seems to be pretty similar to the hackvm `puzzle1` code. The interesting part is following:
```c
printf("[\x1b[32m*\x1b[0m] enter passphrase: ");
gets(acStack_91 + 1);
sVar1 = strlen(acStack_91 + 1);
acStack_91[sVar1] = '\0';
sVar1 = strlen(acStack_91 + 1);
if (sVar1 == 0x40) {
    (*(code *)code)(acStack_91 + 1,0x80000ea4);
    win(acStack_91 + 1);
    return 0;
}
```
First user input is being taken along with the length of the user input which are stored at/in `acStack_91 + 1` and `sVar1`, respectively. If the user input length equals `0x40` (64 in decimal), first a weird pointer to a function is dereferenced and called with the user input and a constant value of 0x80000ea4. Afterwards the win function is executed and zero (success) is returned. We can try setting our arbitrary-password length to 64 which will still result in the same output that we got before. This implies that, as the win function prints something to stdout, the exit syscall (a function that directly interacts with the OS kernel) has to be called somewhere in the weird dereferenced code function. Though, in our converted Ghidra-C-Code, there isn't any function like that anywhere. This means that we have to dive in into the assembly. We can do that by downloading the riscv32 toolchain and using the corresponding gdb (GNU Debugger; use `riscv32-unknown-linux-gnu-gdb puzzle2`). You will find a good RISC-V32 instruction reference [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/resources/su18_lec/Lecture7.pdf). When disassembling the main function (see [here](./code/main.s)) (`disas main`) we see some interesting assembly lines:
```assembly
0x8000014c <+168>:   addi    a1,a1,-348 # 0x80000ea4
0x80000150 <+172>:   mv      a0,sp
0x80000154 <+176>:   auipc   ra,0x1
0x80000158 <+180>:   jalr    -756(ra) # 0x80000e60 <code>
```
We first add -348 to the first least-significant 12 bits of the value saved in the 32-bit register a1. This register is being used as a second parameter at most times. GDB tells us already the value in the a1 register after having completeted the operation: 0x80000ea4. The same value we saw given as a second parameter to the dereferenced function pointer code in our Ghidra-C-Code. Afterwards, we move the value that is stored in sp (stack pointer) to the a0 register which is the address to the input the user gave to the program (the input password base address). a0 is used as a first parameter and that also checks out with our Ghidra code. auipc means add upper immediate to program counter and adds 1 to the most significant 20 bits of the value of the program counter register (which contains the current instruction address) and saves the result in the ra register (return address). The jalr instruction afterwards means jump to address location register which first saves the ra value in a temporary register, assigns the ra register value to be pc + 4 and eventually sets the program counter to the value in the temporary register where we saved the previous ra value subtracted by 756 which, GDB tells us, is the address 0x80000e60 aka `code` (note also that `code` is located inside the .crypto code segment which you will see after having entered `i file`). The new pc value means, that the next instruction to be executed is exactly at 0x80000e60. The auipc + jalr combination is basically just saying that we should first jump to the address of `code` and afterwards return to the instruction after the jalr instruction aka continue in the main function. If you want to know details about why that requires 2 instructions, check out the [RISC-V32 instruction reference](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/resources/su18_lec/Lecture7.pdf) I linked. That means something that the saved meta data describes as `code` is being executed now. Keep the base address 0x80000e60 of `code` in mind. Let's check it out! We can do that by typing `x/25i 0x80000e60` (which translates to e**x**amine the first 25 **i**nstructions at address 0x80000e60) into the running riscv32 gdb session and checking out the results that should consist of instructions. Let's deal with the first few instructions first.
```assembly
0x80000e60 <code>:           lbu     a5,44(a0)
0x80000e64 <code+4>:         lbu     a3,59(a0)
0x80000e68 <code+8>:         li      a4,48
0x80000e6c <code+12>:        mv      a2,a1
0x80000e70 <code+16>:        and     a5,a5,a3
0x80000e74 <code+20>:        beq     a5,a4,0x80000e80 <code+32>
0x80000e78 <code+24>:        li      a7,93
0x80000e7c <code+28>:        ecall
0x80000e80 <code+32>: {...}
```
Here we see that, first, the byte from the value of the register a0 with an offset of 44 is loaded into the a5 register and the same happens with a destination register of a3 and an offset of 59. Remember that in a0 the base address of our input is stored which implies that `44(a0)` is exactly the `input[44]` and `59(a0)` `input[59]`, i.e. the 45th and 60th character in our input password. Afterwards, we load the 32-bit value 48 into the a4 register, move the a1 (our strange second parameter value of 0x80000ea4) into the a2 register. Now it gets interesting. We bitwise and the a5 and a3 registers (which store the 60th and 45th character of our input) and save the result in the a5 register. The next `beq`  instruction can be translated to "move to the address 0x80000e80/code with an offset of 32 if a5 (our bitwise and result) and a4 (the value 48) are equal". If that **isn't** the case we continue with 0x80000e78, move the value 93 into a7 and call an instruction called `ecall`. `ecall` causes a system call, with a determining value of the type of the system call stored in a7. The value 93 in a7 characterizes the *exit system call*. **That means what this code section is actually saying is:**
```c
// pseudo code
if(input[44] & input[59] != 48) {
    exit(failure_exit_code);
}
```
If these operations actually results in 48, we continue with the next instructions:
```assembly
0x80000e80 <code+32>:        lui     a4,0xe681
0x80000e84 <code+36>:        addi    a4,a4,428
0x80000e88 <code+40>:        lw      a5,4(a1)
0x80000e8c <code+44>:        addi    a1,a1,4
0x80000e90 <code+48>:        xor     a3,a5,a4
0x80000e94 <code+52>:        sw      a3,0(a1)
0x80000e98 <code+56>:        bne     a5,a4,0x80000e88 <code+40>
0x80000e9c <code+60>:        addi    a2,a2,4
0x80000ea0 <code+64>:        jr      a2
0x80000ea4 <code+68>:        unimp
0x80000ea6 <code+70>:        unimp
0x80000ea8 <code+72>:        .4byte  0xe5d562f
0x80000eac <code+76>:        .4byte  0xf1d572f
0x80000eb0 <code+80>:        .8byte  0xe6d97bf0d2816bf
0x80000eb8 <code+88>:        .byte   0x1f, 0xd6, 0xbf, 0x0e, 0xcf, 0x97
0x80000ebe <code+94>:        .4byte  0x193f0e8f
```
We immediately notice that until the unimp instructions the instructions look like some logic is happening. The unimp instructions are just both 32-bits filled with zeros. After, from the address 0x80000ea8, the rest seems to be just binary rubbish. The first 2 instructions load 0x0e6811ac into the a4 register (0xe681000 + 428; 428 is decimal). Afterwards, we load the value we gave as a second parameter in the a1 register (0x80000ea4) + 4 into the a5 register and update the a1 register value by also adding 4 to it. That means now the value in the a1 register is 0x80000ea4 + 4 = 0x80000ea8 and in the a5 register whatever is stored at the *address* 0x80000ea4 + 4 = 0x80000ea8 (doesn't this remind you of the binary rubbish address?). That means we treat the second parameter we provided to the function as an address. After, we [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) the value in a4 (0xe681428) with the value in a5 (32-bits at address 0x80000ea8) and save the result in the a3 register. Then, set the 32-bits at the address stored by a1 (0x80000ea8) to the xored value in a3. If a5 (the memory at address 0x80000ea8) is *not* equal to the constant value with which we xored the memory at (0x80000ea8), we jump *back* to the address 0x80000e88. That means we are in a loop!! And when the value in a5 (current 32-bits) is equal to the strange constant value in a4, we close the loop, add 4 to the value stored in a2 (remember that is is just our second initial parameter) and jump to the address stored in a2, which is now 0x80000ea8 again!</br>That means in this loop we continously add 4 to the current address stored in a1, xor the 32-bits at the updated address with our strange value 0x0e6811ac in a4, and continue until the 32 bits at the current memory location are equal to the value 0x0e6811ac itself! (The memory still gets xored when they are equal, and the result of a number a when xored with itself is always 0, so the memory will be zero at that point). Afterwards we are *executing* the memory we just updated, meaning we are executing the instructions we just *created* or *generated* by XOR-Decrypting memory in our `code` section! That's why the code segment we are in is called `.crypto`. Quite fascinating, right? Let's do this decrypting process manually by first e**x**amining the memory from the address 0x80000ea8 to the point where it equals our strange value 0x0e6811ac. It becomes clear that the first 18 32-bit values are being modified as our magic value in the a4 register is located at an offset of 17 * 32 bits of our starting address 0x80000ea8. The command `x/18wx 0x80000ea8` (e**x**amine first 18 **w**ide he**x** (32-bit hex) values from address 0x80000ea8) yields:
```
0x80000ea8 <code+72>:   0x0e5d562f      0x0f1d572f      0x0d2816bf      0x0e6d97bf
0x80000eb8 <code+88>:   0x0ebfd61f      0x0e8f97cf      0x0bb8193f      0x0e6811df
0x80000ec8 <code+104>:  0x18d3969b      0x2e5f16bf      0x0e2db62f      0x0e2d943f
0x80000ed8 <code+120>:  0x0e8fd71f      0x0ebdb18f      0xf08f894f      0x0e2e17bf
0x80000ee8 <code+136>:  0x0e6e11cb      0x0e6811ac
```
Let's just XOR (XOR-decrypt) those values with our constant 0x0e6811ac and interpret the result as RISC-V32 instructions. We can do that interpretation either by *patching the executable* or use a python library called `capstone`. [Here](./code/capstone_xordecrypt.py) you can access the script. </br>
Output:
```assembly
0x80000ea8: lbu a5, 3(a0)
0x80000eac: lbu a3, 0x17(a0)
0x80000eb0: addi a4, zero, 0x34
0x80000eb4: mv a2, a1
0x80000eb8: xor a5, a5, a3
0x80000ebc: beq a5, a4, 0xc
0x80000ec0: addi a7, zero, 0x5d
0x80000ec4: ecall
0x80000ec8: lui a4, 0x16bb8
0x80000ecc: addi a4, a4, 0x203
0x80000ed0: lw a5, 4(a1)
0x80000ed4: addi a1, a1, 4
0x80000ed8: xor a3, a5, a4
0x80000edc: sw a3, 0(a1)
0x80000ee0: bne a5, a4, -0x10
0x80000ee4: addi a2, a2, 4
0x80000ee8: jr a2
```
Nice. This looks quite similar to our previous block, doesn't it? It even has the same amount of lines! Let's take a deeper look onto the changes. Instead of bitewise anding input[44] and input[59] we do a xor of input[3] and input[0x17] and compare it to 0x34. That means our *constraint* for the input by the user is in C-pseudo code:
```c
if(input[3] ^ input[0x17] != 0x34) {
    exit(failure_exit_code);
}
```
If we don't exit we'll do the same loop again just with our magic value being 0x16bb8203. That's it. </br>
Remember that a1 stores the address of the last 32-bits we xored with the previous magic xor value which was the xor value itself and is located at 0x80000ee8 + 4 = 0x80000eec. We do the xor-decryption process again until the next contiguous 32-bits of memory are equal to the xor value again, starting with the base address 0x80000eec + 4 = 0x80000ef0. A little spoiler: the next block will contain a new constraint and a new xor-magic value again and be of the same format like our previous blocks which means it has the same amount of contiguous 32-bit values (instructions): 17. For a 64 bit password there will have to be many constraints to validate it uniquely with each constraint making up just a relation between members of a pair of distinct characters. That's why we should automate the whole process. Let's summarize what we know or assume to hold for all values in the code block. </br>
**Format:**
```
Instruction block of size 17 instructions
32 zero-bits
Encrypted instruction block of size 17 instructions
32-bit MAGIC VALUE (it gets converted to 32 zero bits after decryption)

{This pattern continues (assumption).}
```
where in each instruction block there is a constraint which is used to validate user input (where the only thing that could be successfully validated is probably just a unique sequence of characters). </br>
#### Plan
**So**, the plan is following: We will step into the implementation process now, decrypt each instruction block by using the respective magic value which is directly located after the next encrypted 17-instructions block and exactly 32-bits long until the pattern changes. After that, we will disassemble the decrypted byte-sequence with capstone using the RISCV-32 engine and parse the constraints. Finally, we will use use a SAT-engine (z3) and program it to find possible character sequences matching the regex that was provided by the web app that satisfy all of our constraints.
// continuously doing that and using a pattern to automate this + copy code from ghidra
## Implementation
To copy all the bytes in the code section in an appropriate format, we use a local installation of Ghidra (it is installed by default on Kali Linux). You can do following steps:
```text
1. Launch Ghidra and open a new project consisting of the puzzle2 binary
2. Program Trees (On the right) > puzzle2 > .crypto
3. Symbol Tree (On the right) > Labels > code > {Right Click} > Make Selection
4. {Right Click on the highlighted area} > Copy Special > Byte String (No Spaces)
```
You can see the result [here](./logs/bytes.txt). Each 2 contiguous hex digits represent a byte. We can use this representation to decrypt the instructions. I did that with Java, you can find the file [here](./code/XorDecryptor.java). I just converted the `code` section bytes in bytes.txt to a format suitable for being pasted into a bytes string in python for capstone.
```text
Format:
Each 32 bit instruction is represented like the following:
\x23\x23\x23\x23
```
We have to consider an architecture-dependent trap here. Each multi-byte data type is stored on modern systems in [Little Endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) which means that the least significant byte is stored first or the bytes (*Attention*: **not** the bits) are sorted by significance in ascendent order.
```
Example:
Let's say we have a 32-bit integer: int i = 2
This is 0x00000002 in hex with padded zeros.
In memory, the bytes are stored in "reverse" order on Little Endian systems.
As 2 hex digits describe 1 byte the bytes for the int32 are:
0x00 0x00 0x00 0x02
Then, it is represented like the following in memory:
0x02 0x00 0x00 0x00.
Ex. 2: The uint32 0xdeadbeef is stored in memory on Little Endian systems as 0xef 0xbe 0xad 0xde
```
Let's enter the command `file puzzle2` again into our terminal.
```
Output:
puzzle2: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, UCB RISC-V, soft-float ABI, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped

LSB means "Least Significant Byte" and is nothing else than determining that our executable uses Little Endianness!
MSB means "Most Siginficant Byte" and is analogously defined, the most siginficant byte is stored first in memory.
```
The same happens to our instructions in memory when saved which is why I had to "reverse" the order of bytes before printing them in our [java file](./code/XorDecryptor.java) which you will be able to observe titled below the comment `// REVERSE SECTION`.
```
Output (Java File):
\x83\x47\xc5\x02\x83\x46\xb5\x03\x13\x07\x00\x03\x13\x86\x05\x00\xb3\xf7\xd7\x00\x63\x86\xe7\x00\x93\x08\xd0\x05\x73\x00\x00\x00\x37...{TRUNCATED}
Last bytes after the pattern changed: \x67\x80\x00\x00
```
After using capstone to convert those last pattern-breaking bytes to a RISC-V32 instruction, we get that it actually represents the `ret` ("return") instruction. We only get there if our password input passed all the constraints, in any other way the program will exit. Now that we have all the decrypted instructions ready, let's build a python script that parses the constraints with capstone. I already finished a [script](./code/vmhack.py) that directly converts all the instructions into valid constraints in the form `s.add(pw[2] operation [3] == 0x12)` that we are able to add to a possible SAT solver, in our case we will use z3. </br>
Don't fear, reading z3 is pretty self-explanatory. We create a solver and just plug in all of the information we know about the password:
```
--WANTED--
Name: Password
Length: 64
Matches: regex /hack{[A-Za-z0-9_]+}/
Constraints: execute vmhack.py to see more
```
You'll find a commented script [here](./code/z3vmhacksolve.py). (Remember that you will have to manually install z3 from their github repository for it to run on your computer!!) Let's run it with `python z3vmhacksolve.py`... </br>
```
Output:

hack{5olv1ng_sy5t3ms_of_c0n5tra1nt5_f0r_fun_4nd_pr0f1t_08111996}
```
*VoilÃ .* Now we can paste it into the program.

> **Note**
> I could have done all of that in one python script. While I was working on the problem my problems was that I switched between my Kali Linux vm and my actual home environment for many times and ended up building different scripts on different environments and in different languages. Quite of a chaos.
## Conclusion
We learned about RISC-V32 ELF executables, how to disassemble them with the riscv32 toolchain, some basics about how they are written in Assembly and how self-generating code might be implemented. We learned how to carefully analyze executables, about XOR-Encryption, Ghidra, how to automate instruction-reading for many different architectures in python with capstone, solving systems of constraints in python with z3, about things, such as little endian and its popularity nowadays and code segments such as .text and unnatural ones, such as the .crypto section here. This was the hardest puzzle of HackMIT 2023, congratulations!
